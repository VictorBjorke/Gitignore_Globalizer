# Gitignore Globalizer 🌐

## Overview 📜

Are you tired of dealing with `.DS_Store` files cluttering your Git repositories? The Gitignore Globalizer is here to help streamline your version control.

## What Does It Do? 🚀

This simple shell script accomplishes two essential tasks:

1. Appends `.DS_Store` to your global `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits. 🙅‍♂️
2. Configures Git to use your global `.gitignore` file, ensuring `.DS_Store` is ignored in all your repositories. 🚫

## How to Use 🛠️

1. Clone this repository. 🧬
2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x config-gitignore.sh` 🛠️
3. Run the script: `./config-gitignore.sh` 🚀

That's it! You can now say goodbye to unwanted `.DS_Store` files in your Git repositories.

## Why Use It? 🤔

`.DS_Store` files have been an annoyance for Mac users for years, cluttering up repositories and causing frustration. Gitignore Globalizer simplifies the process of excluding them, enhancing your Git experience.

## Disclaimer 🙏

No `.DS_Store` files were harmed during the creation of this script. They were simply instructed to stay out of your Git repository.
